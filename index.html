         Origrami is the art of paper-folding.  It is originated from the japanese words "ori" meaning "folding" and "kami"<br>
         meaning "paper". Traditional origami consists of folding a single sheet of square paper (often with a colored side) into a sculpture without cutting,<br>
         gluing, taping, or even marking it.<br>
         <br>
